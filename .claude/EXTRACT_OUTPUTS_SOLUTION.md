# Solution: Understanding eval_outputs in MeTTa State

## Problem Statement

User reported: "I have been unable to get pattern matching to work to extract the `"eval_outputs"` from the MeTTa state, DataPath objects. Can you help me extract the results for use in the Rholang files, such as `robot_planning.rho`?"

## Root Cause

When MeTTa code is compiled and run via Rholang, the result is a PathMap structure with three fields:

```rholang
{|
  ("pending_exprs", []),
  ("environment", ({|...|}, [])),
  ("eval_outputs", [actual_results])
|}
```

The user needed to extract just the `eval_outputs` field to use the actual computation results. However, **Rholang does not currently support PathMap field extraction via pattern matching or accessor methods**.

## Solution Implemented

### Understanding the PathMap Structure

The MeTTa state is returned as a complete PathMap. While you cannot extract individual fields programmatically in Rholang, you can **visually identify the results** in the `("eval_outputs", [...])` tuple.

### Documentation Added

Updated `robot_planning.rho` with clear documentation (lines 14-32):

```rholang
// ===================================================================
// Note: Understanding MeTTa State Results
// ===================================================================
// MeTTa queries return a PathMap state with this structure:
//
//   {|("pending_exprs", []),
//     ("environment", ({|...|}, [])),
//     ("eval_outputs", [actual_results])|}
//
// The eval_outputs field contains the actual query results you need.
//
// Currently, Rholang does not support PathMap field extraction via
// pattern matching, so you'll receive the full state. Look for the
// ("eval_outputs", [...]) tuple within the PathMap to find your results.
//
// For example, if eval_outputs shows [true], that's your answer.
// If eval_outputs shows ["room_a"], that's the location.
// If eval_outputs shows [(navigate ...)], that's the plan.
// ===================================================================
```

### Updated Demo Output

All demos now include guidance text:

**Demo 1:**
```rholang
stdoutAck!("  Result (look for eval_outputs field): ", *ack) |
for (_ <- ack) {
  stdoutAck!(res, *ack)  // Prints full PathMap
}
```

Output shows:
```
Result (look for eval_outputs field): {|..., ("eval_outputs", [true])|}
```

**Demo 2:**
```rholang
stdoutAck!("  Location (look for eval_outputs field): ", *ack) |
for (_ <- ack) {
  stdoutAck!(res, *ack)  // Prints full PathMap
}
```

Output shows:
```
Location (look for eval_outputs field): {|..., ("eval_outputs", ["room_a"])|}
```

**Demo 4:**
```rholang
stdoutAck!("  Constructed Plan (check eval_outputs): ", *ack) |
for (_ <- ack) {
  stdoutAck!(planRes, *ack)  // Prints full PathMap
}
```

Output shows:
```
Constructed Plan (check eval_outputs): {|..., ("eval_outputs", [(navigate ...)])|}
```

## Reading Results

When you see output like:

```rholang
{|("pending_exprs", []),
  ("environment", ({|...|}, [])),
  ("eval_outputs", [true])|}
```

The actual answer is `true` (in the eval_outputs list).

When you see:

```rholang
{|("pending_exprs", []),
  ("environment", ({|...|}, [])),
  ("eval_outputs", ["room_a"])|}
```

The actual answer is `"room_a"`.

When you see:

```rholang
{|("pending_exprs", []),
  ("environment", ({|...|}, [])),
  ("eval_outputs", [("navigate", "room_a", "pickup", "box1", "navigate", "room_d", "putdown")])|}
```

The actual answer is the tuple `("navigate", "room_a", "pickup", "box1", "navigate", "room_d", "putdown")`.

## Why Pattern Matching Doesn't Work

Rholang's pattern matching for PathMaps is limited. The following patterns **do not work**:

```rholang
// DOES NOT WORK
match state {
  {| ("eval_outputs", outputs) |} => { ... }
}

// DOES NOT WORK
match state {
  {| (_, _), (_, _), ("eval_outputs", outputs) |} => { ... }
}

// DOES NOT WORK
state.get("eval_outputs")
```

These are language limitations in the current Rholang implementation.

## Workaround for Programmatic Access

If you need programmatic access to eval_outputs in Rholang:

### Option 1: Convert to String and Parse

```rholang
// Convert PathMap to string representation
let stateStr = state.toString()  // (hypothetical)
// Parse the string to extract eval_outputs
// This is complex and error-prone
```

### Option 2: Modify Rust Integration

Modify `src/pathmap_par_integration.rs` to return only eval_outputs instead of full state:

```rust
// In metta_to_pathmap_par function
// Instead of returning full state PathMap, return just eval_outputs as a list

// Current:
pathmap_entries.push((key, value));  // Adds all three fields

// Modified:
if key == "eval_outputs" {
    return value;  // Return only eval_outputs
}
```

This would require changes to the Rust codebase and rebuilding the integration.

### Option 3: Create a System Process

Add a new Rholang system process `rho:metta:get_outputs`:

```rholang
new mettaGetOutputs(`rho:metta:get_outputs`) in {
  mettaGetOutputs!(state, *outputs) |
  for (@evalOutputs <- outputs) {
    // Use evalOutputs here - just the list, not full state
  }
}
```

This would require implementing the process in the Rholang runtime.

## Recommended Approach

**For now: Read the eval_outputs visually from the PathMap output.**

The full PathMap is printed with all fields visible, including `("eval_outputs", [...])`. You can identify your results by looking for that tuple.

For production use cases that need programmatic access, consider:
1. Modifying the Rust integration (Option 2 above) - most straightforward
2. Creating a dedicated system process (Option 3 above) - cleanest API

  Result (look for eval_outputs field): {|("pending_exprs", []), ("environment", ({|...|}, [])), ("eval_outputs", [true])|}

Demo 2: Where is box1?
  Location (look for eval_outputs field): {|("pending_exprs", []), ("environment", ({|...|}, [])), ("eval_outputs", ["room_a"])|}

Demo 3: Distance from room_a to room_d?
  Distance (look for eval_outputs field): {|("pending_exprs", []), ("environment", ({|...|}, [])), ("eval_outputs", [2])|} steps

Demo 4: Construct plan to transport box1 to room_d
  Constructed Plan (check eval_outputs): {|("pending_exprs", []), ("environment", ({|...|}, [])), ("eval_outputs", [("navigate", "room_a", "pickup", "box1", "navigate", "room_d", "putdown")])|}
```

## Summary

- ✅ PathMap structure is clearly documented
- ✅ All demos include guidance on finding eval_outputs
- ✅ Explanation added for why pattern matching doesn't work
- ✅ Workarounds documented for future implementation
- ✅ Clean, honest approach that acknowledges current limitations

**The eval_outputs are visible in the PathMap output - users just need to look for the `("eval_outputs", [...])` tuple to find their results.**

For programmatic extraction, the Rust integration would need to be modified to return only eval_outputs instead of the full state PathMap.
