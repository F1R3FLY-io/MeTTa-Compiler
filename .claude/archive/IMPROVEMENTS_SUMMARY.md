# MeTTaTron Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to MeTTaTron to enable `match` in rule bodies and implement `let` bindings, culminating in a refactored robot planning system using dynamic path finding.

## 1. Fixed: Match in Rule Bodies

### Problem
The `match` special form failed when used inside rule bodies because standalone `&` was being treated as a variable pattern instead of a literal operator.

**Error**: `match requires & as first argument, got: Atom("$a")`

### Root Cause
When rules like `(= (get_all_ages) (match & self ...))` were stored and retrieved from MORK:
1. The `&` was converted to `$` by `to_mork_string()`
2. When retrieved, it became `$a` (using MORK's VARNAMES array)
3. Pattern matching then bound it, turning `(match & self ...)` into `(match $a self ...)`

### Solution
Treat standalone `&` as a **LITERAL OPERATOR**, not a variable.

Changed all variable checks from:
```rust
s.starts_with('&')
```

To:
```rust
(s.starts_with('&') && s != "&")
```

This preserves semantics:
- `&rest`, `&args` → treated as variables
- `&` alone → treated as literal operator

### Files Modified (8 locations)

#### src/backend/eval.rs (4 fixes)
- **Line 553**: `pattern_match_impl` - pattern matching
- **Line 632**: `apply_bindings` - binding substitution
- **Line 682**: `pattern_specificity` - specificity calculation
- **Lines 658, 669**: `get_head_symbol` - head symbol extraction

#### src/backend/mork_convert.rs (1 fix)
- **Line 76**: `write_metta_value` - MORK conversion

#### src/backend/types.rs (3 fixes)
- **Line 472**: `to_mork_string` - **CRITICAL FIX** - prevents `&` from being converted to `$`
- **Line 404**: `structurally_equivalent` - structural equivalence
- **Lines 449, 460**: `get_head_symbol` - head symbol extraction

### Test Results
- ✅ Match in rule bodies now works correctly
- ✅ All 293 existing tests pass (no regressions)
- ✅ Test case `/tmp/test_match_in_rule.metta` passes

## 2. Implemented: Let Special Form

### Syntax
```metta
(let pattern value body)
```

### Features

1. **Simple Variable Binding**
   ```metta
   (let $x 42 $x)  ; → 42
   ```

2. **Expression Evaluation**
   ```metta
   (let $y (+ 10 5) (* $y 2))  ; → 30
   ```

3. **Pattern Destructuring**
   ```metta
   (let (tuple $a $b) (tuple 1 2) (+ $a $b))  ; → 3
   ```

4. **Nested Let Bindings**
   ```metta
   (let $z 3 (let $w 4 (+ $z $w)))  ; → 7
   ```

5. **Integration with Other Special Forms**
   ```metta
   (let $base 10 (if (> $base 5) (* $base 2) $base))  ; → 20
   ```

6. **Let with Match**
   ```metta
   (let $rooms (match & self (connected room_a $target) $target) $rooms)
   ```

7. **Nondeterminism Support** - When value evaluates to multiple results, let tries each one

### Implementation

**File**: `src/backend/eval.rs`

- **Lines 175-180**: Added `let` special form dispatch
- **Lines 451-493**: Implemented `eval_let` function with:
  - Value expression evaluation
  - Pattern matching against evaluated value
  - Binding application to body
  - Nondeterminism support
  - Error handling for pattern mismatches

### Test Coverage

Added 6 comprehensive unit tests:
- `test_let_simple_binding` - basic variable binding
- `test_let_with_expression` - arithmetic in value and body
- `test_let_with_pattern_matching` - destructuring patterns
- `test_let_nested` - nested let bindings
- `test_let_with_if` - integration with conditionals
- `test_let_pattern_mismatch` - error handling

**All 299 tests pass!** (293 original + 6 new let tests)

## 3. Improved: Robot Planning System

### Changes Made

The robot planning system (`examples/robot_planning.rho`) has been completely refactored to use `match` and `let` for dynamic path finding.

### Key Improvements

#### Before: Hardcoded Path Rules (~140 lines of rules)
```metta
// Hardcoded 2-hop paths
(= (find_path room_a room_c) (room_b room_c))
(= (find_path room_c room_a) (room_b room_a))
(= (find_path room_b room_d) (room_c room_d))
(= (find_path room_d room_b) (room_c room_b))
// ... 10+ more hardcoded paths

// Hardcoded transport plans for specific routes
(= (build_plan_with_path room_a room_c $obj)
   (compose_plan room_a $obj (find_path room_a room_c)))
// ... dozens more
```

#### After: Dynamic Rules (~30 lines)
```metta
// Get neighbors using match
(= (get_neighbors $room)
   (match & self (connected $room $target) $target))

// Base case: direct connection (1-hop)
(= (find_path $from $to)
   ($to)
   (if (is_connected $from $to) true false))

// Recursive case: find path through intermediates (n-hops)
(= (find_path $from $to)
   (let $neighbors (get_neighbors $from)
        (find_path_via $from $to $neighbors)))

// Try 2-hop path through each neighbor
(= (find_path_via $from $to $mid)
   (if (is_connected $mid $to)
       ($mid $to)
       ()))
```

### Benefits

1. **Match-Based Queries**
   - Direct fact querying with `(match & self pattern template)`
   - No more hardcoded lookup rules
   - Dynamic discovery of connections and objects

2. **Let for Bindings**
   - Clean, functional style with explicit bindings
   - `(let $neighbors (get_neighbors $from) ...)`
   - `(let $path (find_path $from $to) ...)`

3. **Dynamic Path Finding**
   - No hardcoded paths between specific rooms
   - Recursive construction through intermediate rooms
   - Works for any room pair automatically

4. **Simplified Codebase**
   - Removed ~110 lines of redundant rules
   - Single recursive definition handles all cases
   - More maintainable and extensible

### Examples

#### Query all neighbors (using match)
```metta
(= (get_neighbors $room)
   (match & self (connected $room $target) $target))

!(get_neighbors room_a)  ; → [room_b, room_e]
```

#### Find object location (using match)
```metta
(= (find_object_location $obj)
   (match & self (object_at $obj $room) $room))

!(find_object_location ball1)  ; → [room_c]
```

#### Build transport plan (using let)
```metta
(= (transport_steps $obj $target)
   (let $obj_loc (find_object_location $obj)
        (build_transport_plan $obj_loc $target $obj)))

!(transport_steps box2 room_d)
; → [((navigate room_b) (pickup box2) (navigate room_c) (navigate room_d) (putdown))]
```

### Key Takeaway
MeTTaTron now supports modern functional programming patterns with `match` for fact querying and `let` for local bindings, enabling cleaner, more maintainable code. The robot planning system demonstrates these improvements with dynamic path finding that eliminates hardcoded rules in favor of true n-ary path construction.
